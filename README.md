   <td width="748">4. This week’s programming task requires you to submit a screenshot of your running program as a discussion forum post. You should aim to get the help of your tutors and make further revisions. <strong>Your first post does not need to fully work for you to post and get help</strong>.<strong>Coding exercise steps (Hint: </strong><strong>Need help?</strong> Your tutors will give you a brief demonstration during the ‘tutor chats’ this week. You can also ask your tutor via Canvas→<a href="https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/70691/discussion_topics">Discussions→IIE01</a><strong>):</strong>a. Get Eclipse IDE to work on your computer by installing the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html">Oracle JDK</a> then the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse IDE for Java Developers</a>. b. Download the <strong>Week01.zip</strong> template Eclipse project <strong>archive file</strong> from: <a href="https://jupiter.csit.rmit.edu.au/~e58140/GTerm/">https://jupiter.csit.rmit.edu.au/~e58140/GTerm/</a>… then import it in to Eclipse as an “<strong>existing project in to workspace</strong>”.c.                    Make a copy of the ‘Week01’ project and rename it to ‘IIE01’ from within Eclipse. Then rename the PleaseRenameMe.java under IIE01→src folder from within Eclipse to any name that you like as long as it follows the naming convention for classes as given in the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/allclasses-index.html">Java API</a> and is not “HelloWorld” (can you spot the rules and conventions around class names?). (Tip: Do not rename folders or files from outside of Eclipse as this could lead to issues.) Run the program and verify that the output is as shown during the lecture. <strong>If you have an issue, ask your tutor</strong> or post a screenshot of the issue under Canvas→Discussions→IIE01.d.                   Change the message from “hello world”, etc. to something of your own choosing. Now also experiment with the following statements to make your output more interesting:gt.setXY(70,50); gt.setFontSize(16);gt.setFontColor(255,0,0); // Experiment with values between 0-255 (inclusive)gt.setBackgroundColor(127,127,255); // Experiment with values between 0-255 (inclusive)String enteredString=gt.getInputString(“Enter something”); // Together with gt.print or gt.println gt.addImageIcon(gt.getFilePath());Remember to check the <a href="https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/70691/discussion_topics/959974">GTerm Help forum</a> for additional tips and the <a href="https://jupiter.csit.rmit.edu.au/~e58140/GTerm/">GTerm Java Doc</a> for more features that we will use later. If you need more help, remember to <strong>ask your friendly tutor!</strong>e.                    The final version of the program that you submit must <strong>must not have any red dots</strong> (Java errors) as code with such errors cannot be tested/marked and will receive 0 for that submission. Submit your work with the red dot, ask for help from your tutor and update your code so that the final version does not have red dots. Yellow dots are warnings and these are different.<strong>Continued…</strong></td>

The following task will be covered during the ‘Tutor Chat’ run by your group tutors. See their chat schedule under <a href="https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/70691/external_tools/546">Canvas→Collaborate</a> <a href="https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/70691/external_tools/546">Ultra</a>.

   <td width="748">7. Progress submissions: The work that you will do in IIEs are relevant to concepts that you are required to demonstrate in the assignment. You should also think of completing IIEs as making preliminary progress towards meeting assignment requirements (note that major assignments will have their own set of requirements). When you are yet to start on an actual assignment, submit the .java file from your most recent IIE as a progress submission in to the actual assignment.In this exercise, you must perform <em>progress </em>submissions for assignments 1, 2 and 3 by following the steps below. Note: You do not need to write any additional code for these submissions; just what you wrote for IIE01 is adequate.a. As shown during the week 1 live lecture, copy your IIE01 Eclipse project and rename the project to Assignment1.Now repeat this process to create separate projects for Assignments 2 and 3 as well. In total you should have4 projects (1 for IIE01 and 3 for the assignments) aside from the “Week 1 template” project.</td>

 <li>Reply to your own post created in #4 above and add a discussion of the following terms in your own words: code <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/expressions.html"><strong>block</strong></a> and <a href="https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/70691/pages/data-types?module_item_id=2768985">data type</a>. The emphasis is on explaining things in your own words rather than on the accuracy of your explanation.</li>

</ol>

If you have completed this IIE correctly, you would now have at least two posts under the IIE01 forum.

   <td width="748">Tip for later: Assignment 1 might require you to name your .java file in a specific way for the actual/final submission.b. Canvas has two submission systems. The one we use for major assignments (Assignments 1, 2 and 3) requires you to upload files (not a discussion forum post). This file upload submission system allows you to submit your work an unlimited number of times (only the last submission is official) and it can also be used as a way to backup your work. You must submit the three .java files that you’ve created above as follows (your file names may be different):Workspace folder→Assignment1→src→<strong>HelloWorld.java</strong> must be submitted to Canvas→Assignments→Assignment <strong>1</strong>.Workspace folder→Assignment2→src→<strong>HelloWorld .java </strong>must be submitted to Canvas→Assignments→Assignment <strong>2</strong>.Workspace folder→Assignment3→src→<strong>HelloWorld .java</strong> must be submitted to Canvas→Assignments→Assignment <strong>3</strong>.Common mistake: Students mistakenly submit the dummy assignments via Canvas→Assignments→Independent Investigative Effort 1, etc. Tip: The submission system might rename your file upon further submissions and do not worry about this.</td>
